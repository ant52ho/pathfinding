# pathfinding

### This is my grade 10 CS class culminating assignment.
### Given a file name containing a maze, it will output the solution to the maze.
### As a fun fact, this is the course that got me into computer science, because I found logic + algorithms to be so cool.
#
#### This project brings me many fond memories~
