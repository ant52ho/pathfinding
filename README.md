# A* Pathfinding

##### This is my grade 10 CS class culminating assignment.
##### Given a file name containing a maze, it will output the solution to the maze using the A* algorithm!
##### As a fun fact, this is the course that got me into computer science, because I found logic + algorithms to be so cool.
#
### Instructions for use:
###### 1. Google "Maze Generator"
###### 2. Download a png of the maze (alternatively, use one of the sample mazes stored in this repo)
###### 3. Store it in the same directory as "path.py"
###### 4. Run path.py
###### 5. Follow the onscreen prompts after installing dependencies.
###### 6. The solved maze will be stored in "final.png"

#### This project brings me many fond memories~
